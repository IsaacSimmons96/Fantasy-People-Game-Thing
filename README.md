Joint project with my friend Harry. Aim is to make a nice little program that will generate some NPCs for dungeons and dragons.

I (isaac) will be creating a custom GUI library for use for this project (and future ones) to display the information and make decisions about the dungeons and dragons non player characters generated. I will also be handling the code for NPC information.

Harry will be ocaisionally helping out with the NPC side of things whilst i teach him C++ from scratch.
